Introduction
This project provides a Python implementation of Pascal's Triangle. Pascal's Triangle is a mathematical construct where each number is the sum of the two directly above it. The triangle starts with a single 1 and expands according to this rule.

Task
The main task of this project is to create a function pascal_triangle(n) that returns a list of lists of integers representing Pascalâ€™s Triangle of n. The function should return an empty list if n is less than or equal to 0.

The provided test script, 0-main.py, demonstrates the function's usage and expected output.
